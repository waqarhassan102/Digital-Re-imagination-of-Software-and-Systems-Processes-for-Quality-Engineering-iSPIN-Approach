# Digital-Re-imagination-of-Software-and-Systems-Processes-for-Quality-Engineering-iSPIN-Approach
Software quality has become the lever of differentiation in today’s competitive marketplace. Quality at speed is the customer demand and automation is the biggest bottleneck holding the evolution of quality function. Increased levels of automation and intelligence in software engineering are the emerging trends across the IT field. As systems and software processes guide the life cycle activities and are the vehicles for building quality, it is necessary to look at the process infrastructure for the extent of process automation support provided and the digital enablement. This paper maps out the existing process infrastructure support in industry practice and proposes a roadmap for digital re-imagination of software and systems processes. Harmonizing the quality engineering themes with digital technologies, we propose a framework for building an intelligent software process infrastructure, iSPIN that can help in digital re-imagination of software and systems lifecycle processes. The framework has been implemented using digital technologies and has been piloted with one of the industry business unit for re-imagination of “proposal process”. The proposed iSPIN framework will help in unprecedented automation and quality
